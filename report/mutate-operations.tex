\subsection{Mutatation operations}
\label{sec:mutate-operations}

The solution schedule is defined as list of $(c \in C, t \in T, r \in R)$. Which means course $c$ is assigned to a slot given by the time $t$ and room $r$.

In this project 4 move operations are used. The operations are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Add($c, t, r$)} - adds course $c$ to the slot $(t, r)$.  
\item \texttt{Remove($c, t, r$)} - remove course $c$ from the schedule slot $(t, r)$.
\item \texttt{Move($c, t_0, r_0, t_1, r_1$)} - moves course $c$ from $(t_0, r_0)$ to $(t_1, r_1)$.
\item \texttt{Swap($c_0, t_0, r_0, c_1, t_1, r_1$)} - course $c_0$ and course $c_1$ swap slots.
\end{itemize}

To avoid copying the solution object, it should be possible to calculate the $\Delta$ cost without actually changing the solution object. Those functions are prefixed with \texttt{Simulate}, while the functions that actually changes the solution object are prefixed with \texttt{Mutate}.

Note that one typically simulates the operation to check that $\Delta < 0$ and then mutate the solution object. Thus it makes sense to add $\Delta$ as an optional argument to the mutate functions, to avoid unnecessary calculations. This was done in the implementation but is for simplicity excluded here.

The \texttt{Move} and \texttt{Swap} operations can then be implemented, using using the \texttt{Add} and \texttt{Remove} primitives. This is not the most efficient implementation as it requires mutation of the current solution, which are then reverted in the simulation case. However given the time constraints of the project, more efficient implementations wasn't made. See appendix \ref{appendix:operations} for how \texttt{Move} and \texttt{Swap} was implemented using the primitives.
